# AS Graphic Studio Webmaster

Hello, here is my website for AS Graphic Studio. This project's tech stack includes Next.js and SASS CSS. 

## Running Locally

Pre reqs:
Ensure that node.js is installed on your device. Link to download if you have not done so:(https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

First, run the following command to install node_modules:

```
npm install
```

Second, create a .env file in the root directory of the project and paste the environment variables.
IMPORTANT: Do not push any of the information from .env to GitHub. These keys could give unauthorized access to the database. Ensure that ".env" is added to .gitignore.

Third, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
